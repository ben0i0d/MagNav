# Signal Enhancement for Magnetic Navigation Challenge Problem

This is a repository for the signal enhancement for magnetic navigation (MagNav) challenge problem [MagNav](https://github.com/MIT-AI-Accelerator/MagNav.jl) [an older version](https://github.com/lw-kong/MagNav_2020.jl), which was introduced at JuliaCon 2020.

Please refer to "Introduction.pdf" for a brief introduction of our methods and some examples of our results. 

## How to run our codes
Step 1: Copy data files "Flt1002-train.h5" and "Flt1003-train.h5" into the "data" folder.

Step 2: Run "runs/pre_TL.jl". 

This pre-filters the data of flight 1003 by the Tolles-Lawson method. A file "runs/data_TL.h5" should be generated by this script.

Step 3: Run "runs/main.m". 

The variable "output_line_number" has already been set to "1003.10", which is the line number to be filtered. Two figures demonstraing the performance of the filtering should be generated, and the variable "y_filtered" is the output filtered data.

The Deep Learning Toolbox of Matlab is required.
